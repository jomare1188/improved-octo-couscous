## Repository with DOLORES RNAseq analysis
#
# In short: the code here preproccess data (fastqc-bbduk), quanify (salmon), annotate (pannzer and blast), Differential expression analysis, GO functional erichment and venn diagrams.
#
# each directory has a small README describing what is there
#
# The data used is located in RAWDATA/ that was the initial data provided by DOLORES
# RAWDATA2 and RAWDATA3 are unused
#
# pipeline
# pre_FastQC -> pre_multiqc -> bbduk -> post_FastQC -> post_multiqc -> quant_test
#
# The results from quant_test shows that longest_transcript performed very similary to protein_coding and all_transcripts, mapping almost all our sequences in the smallest set
# We choose longest_transcript
#
# In RNAseq directory we found scripts for RNAseq pipeline (see RNAseq README.MD)
