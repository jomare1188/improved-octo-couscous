# Exposure of Sugarcane Plants to Drought Cycles at Different Phenological Stages

## Experimental Design

Three-month-old sugarcane seedlings of genotypes **IACSP95-5000** (productive material) and **IACCTC07-8008** (drought-tolerant material) developed by the Sugarcane Breeding Program of the Agronomic Institute (ProCana, IAC, Brazil) were transplanted into 20 L pots containing red-yellow latosol and fertilized. Cultivation was carried out in a greenhouse with daily irrigation.

## Treatment Groups

At five months of age (from transplant date), plants were divided into three experimental groups per genotype (total of six groups).

### a) W (Well-watered)
- **Treatment**: Maintained under daily irrigation
- **Purpose**: Control group

### b) T (Tillering)  
- **Treatment**: Subjected to three drought cycles during the tillering phase
- **Purpose**: Assess drought stress during vegetative growth

### c) M (Maturation)
- **Treatment**: Subjected to three drought cycles during the maturation phase  
- **Purpose**: Assess drought stress during reproductive development

## Drought Cycle Protocol

**Drought induction**: Irrigation suspension for **9 days**

**Recovery period**: Plants re-irrigated for **6 days** after each drought interval

**Total cycles**: 3 drought/recovery cycles per treatment group

This experimental design allows for the evaluation of genotype-specific responses to drought stress at two different developmental stages in sugarcane.

W (control), plants maintained with irrigation throughout the experiment; T, plants subjected to three drought cycles (D1, D2, D3) during the tillering phase; M, plants subjected to three drought cycles (D1, D2, D3) during the maturation phase.

# Propagule Experiment

At the end of the experiment, stem cuttings were collected and new seedlings were vegetatively propagated from the above experimental groups to carry out the propagule experiment where we evaluated the "heritability" of drought memory.

Three-month-old sugarcane seedlings of genotypes IACSP95-5000 and IACCTC07-8008 obtained through vegetative propagation from groups W, T and M were transplanted into 12 L pots containing red-yellow latosol and fertilized. Cultivation was carried out in a greenhouse with daily irrigation.

At two months of age (from transplant), plants were divided and drought treatment was initiated in both genotypes (total of 12 groups):

## Treatment Groups

### a) W/D
- **Origin**: Propagules obtained from non-stressed plants
- **Treatment**: Subjected to one drought cycle

### b) W/W  
- **Origin**: Propagules obtained from non-stressed plants
- **Treatment**: Well-watered

### c) T/D
- **Origin**: Propagules obtained from plants stressed during tillering
- **Treatment**: Subjected to one drought cycle

### d) T/W
- **Origin**: Propagules obtained from plants stressed during tillering  
- **Treatment**: Well-watered

### e) M/D
- **Origin**: Propagules obtained from plants stressed during maturation
- **Treatment**: Subjected to one drought cycle

### f) M/W
- **Origin**: Propagules obtained from plants stressed during maturation
- **Treatment**: Well-watered

## Drought Cycle Protocol

**Drought induction**: Irrigation suspension for **9 days**

**Recovery period**: Plants re-irrigated after the cycle completion (**6 days** recovery)
